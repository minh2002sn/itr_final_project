* **STM32 Microcontroller**: The project is based on the STM32 microcontroller platform, which offers a wide range of microcontrollers with different performance levels and features.
*  **STM32CubeIDE**: The project was developed using popular IDEs which is STM32CubeIDE, provide tools for code development, debugging, and firmware deployment.
*  **Communication Protocols**: The project includes the implementation of communication protocols such as UART, I2C, SPI, and wireless protocols like BLE .
*  **Peripheral Libraries**: The project utilizes peripheral libraries provided by the microcontroller manufacturer or third-party libraries to simplify the integration and configuration of peripherals.
*  **Other Device**: We intergrated a lot of device to increase experiment of customer and performance of device .
*  See our [document](./feature_of_project.md), [system architecture](./firmware_layer_interact.pu) and **system design** for more details .

## Features

**ECG Monitor** offers a wide range of features designed to provide comprehensive and reliable heart monitoring solutions such as:

1. **ECG Reading + Digital Filtering:**
  - Utilizes advanced sensors and digital filtering to deliver precise and consistent electrocardiogram readings.

2. **Pulse Output to GUI:**
  - Displays real-time ECG waveforms on a graphical user interface for easy monitoring and analysis.

3. **Heart Rate Measurement:**
  - Accurately measures and displays the heart rate based on ECG data.

4. **Alerts for High or Low Heart Rate:**
  - Provides alerts through LED indicators and a buzzer if the heart rate exceeds or falls below set thresholds.


## Usage
1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub â†—](https://github.com/vyluu-itr/06-2024-itr-intern-group-2).
2. Set up your development environment with the required IDE (STM32CubeIDE) and toolchain and open the project in the chosen IDE.
3. Read our **diagram**<!--[diagram](./doc/pic/.png)--> to connect the necessary peripherals or sensors to the STM32 microcontroller.
4. Deploy the firmware to the STM32 microcontroller using the appropriate flashing method (e.g., ST-Link, DFU, or bootloader).
